# APK is Alkohol Per Krona
APK translated is alcohol per SEK.

The APK can easily be calculated because Sweden has an alcohol monopoly, meaning there is a single
supplier, called Systembolaget, for any drinks with an alcohol amount above 3.5 percent by volume.

This software uses the open data that Systembolaget supplies, and calculates how the alcohol amount
relates to the price and volume of the product.
